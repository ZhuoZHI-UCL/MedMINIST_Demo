# MedMINIST_Demo
Binary/multiple classification using MedMINIST dataset
## Binary classification task by MedMINIST-pneumoniamnist dataset
* Motivation: exploring whether basic machine learning models can competent in image binary classification tasks

* Dataset: MedMINIST-pneumoniamnist (greyscale image)

* Model: RandomForestClassifier

## Multiple classification task by MedMINIST-pathmnist dataset
* Motivation: exploring whether basic machine learning models can competent in image multiple classification tasks

* Dataset: MedMINIST-pathmnist (RGB image)

* Model: RandomForestClassifier

## Key points
* We find that basic models can handle these tasks
* Feature extraction is important for basic models and we have compared several approaches
